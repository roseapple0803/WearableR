**NOTE: 66 feature variables are used for the final data**

Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

The features selected for the study come from the accelerometer, gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ, and other signals. For example, 

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

There are a total of 561 feature variables that were estimated from these signals and they are:: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors

For the purpose of our project, however, we are only interested in the measurement variables related to the mean value and the standard deviation. There are 66 feature variables with mean() and std() in their names. meanFreq() is excluded as it is a function calculating something else other than mean(). 




**Transformations to create a tidy data set **

The raw data sets come from the following files:

- features.txt: List of all features.
- activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels with their activity name.
- train/X_train.txt: Training set.
- train/y_train.txt: Training labels.
- test/X_test.txt: Test set.
- test/y_test.txt: Test labels.
- train/subject_train.txt
- test/subject_test.txt


Task 1: Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
	. Measurement data from the raw data sets, train/X_train.txt and test/X_test.txt, are merged 
	. Label data from the raw data sets, train/y_train.txt and test/y_test.txt, are merged  
	. Subject data from the raw data sets, train/subject_train.txt and test/subject_test.txt, are merged 

Task 2: Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement 
	. Create a subset of feature list with mean() or std() in their variable names 
	. Removed "(", ")", and replaced "-" with "_" in mean_sd_features to ensure legitimate feature variable names 
	. Create a subset of measurements based on mean_sd_features --> mean_sd_data

Task 3: Join the data from labels with the data from activity so that labels are associated with activity names

Task 4: create a data set with descriptive variable names by merging all subjects, activity labels, and the measured data 

Task 5: create data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, also write the data set to a text file, tidydata.txt
